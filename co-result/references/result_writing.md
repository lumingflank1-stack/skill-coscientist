# Result Writing Guide

## Purpose

Use this guide when drafting a Chinese biomedical Results section from experiment designs, partial results, actual results, assumed-positive findings, or explicitly requested simulated findings.

## Result Logic

For each experiment, extract:

1. The biological question.
2. The assay or dataset.
3. The sample or model.
4. The comparison.
5. The expected or observed direction.
6. The figure panel.
7. The claim strength.
8. The source mode: input, assumed, simulated, or requirements-only.

Write in the order of evidence, not in the order of experimental operations when the logic would read better otherwise. A common order is:

1. Rationale or model panel.
2. Representative assay result.
3. Quantification or statistics.
4. Orthogonal validation.
5. Integrative conclusion and boundary.

## Chinese Style

Use compact manuscript language:

- Prefer `结果显示`, `进一步`, `与此一致`, `提示`, `支持`, `说明`.
- Avoid grant-like language such as `我们拟`, `本课题将`, `具有重大意义`.
- Avoid Discussion-heavy interpretation in Results. Short mechanistic linking is allowed when needed to explain why panels are grouped.

## Panel Citation

Index each result with figure panels in the body:

- Single panel: `（Figure 1A）`
- Multiple panels: `（Figure 1A-D）`
- Cross-figure synthesis: `（Figure 1D, Figure 2C）`

Mention a panel the first time the evidence is described, not only at paragraph endings.

## Claim Strength

Use direct claim language only when the assay supports it:

| Evidence type | Appropriate claim | Avoid |
|---|---|---|
| Co-IP | `处于同一复合物或相邻蛋白复合体中` | `直接结合`, unless purified binding also shown |
| SPR/BLI/ITC with purified proteins | `发生直接亲和结合` | `证明体内机制`, unless paired with in vivo evidence |
| Representative Western blot | `可检测到`, `显示富集` | `显著`, unless quantified |
| Quantification with replicates | `显著升高/降低` | exact P if not available |
| Schematic | `模型示意`, `提出工作模型` | `证明` |
| Transcriptomics correlation | `相关`, `一致`, `候选轴` | `导致`, `驱动`, unless perturbation evidence exists |

## Missing Numeric Details

If the user did not provide sample size, exact P value, fold change, Kd, confidence interval, or software fit output:

- Write directionally in the Results.
- Use placeholders sparingly in notes, not in polished body text.
- Mark exact values as to be replaced after real data are available.

## Biological Boundary Note

When a family member is mentioned but not directly assayed, keep it as a candidate or related molecule. For example, if only SV2A is validated, write SV2B as `候选延伸对象` or `同家族相关分子`, not as a proven binding target.
