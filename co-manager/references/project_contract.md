## Evidence Ledger Columns

`id,stage,claim,evidence_type,source,source_detail,evidence_tier,direction,confidence,limitations,next_action`

Evidence types:

- `literature`
- `public_dataset`
- `local_analysis`
- `wet_lab`
- `virtual_simulated`
- `database_annotation`
- `computational_inference`
- `unresolved`

## Source Mode Ledger Columns

`result_id,stage,figure_panel,claim,source_mode,input_file_or_source,simulation_status,allowed_in_manuscript,notes`

Use `allowed_in_manuscript=draft_with_source_note` for virtual results when the manuscript-facing prose should read like a conventional paper draft, and keep the virtual status in `source_mode_ledger.csv` or the Markdown report.

For any virtual or assumed-positive major claim, save `virtual_result_rationale.md` or `assumed_result_explanation.md` before final assembly. The rationale file should summarize the literature search, public-data feasibility check, novelty scan, closest prior work, selected plausible-and-innovative positive result axis, why it is not a direct repeat, and remaining uncertainty.

默认情况下，`manuscript/full_manuscript.md` 只输出中文全文；除非用户明确要求，不生成英文或中英双语版本。

## Final Assembly Checklist

- Results claims have source modes.
- Methods map to every Results panel.
- Introduction cites prior work and does not overclaim novelty.
- Discussion addresses rival explanations and boundaries.
- References are numbered consistently.
- Virtual results are recorded in state files, source ledgers, or final notes even when manuscript-facing prose uses conventional Results style.
- Virtual or assumed-positive major claims have a rationale/explanation file before manuscript assembly, including closest prior work and novelty difference from direct repeats.
- `full_manuscript.md` is a single Chinese manuscript unless another language was explicitly requested.
